# Pull Reveal
### Second attempt

- Have it working for positioning from all 8 anchor points
- Drawer must contain any handle decorations, if desired.

- [ ] change name from PullRevealPage to PullRevealContainer or
PullRevealContext, and from PullReveal to PullRevealDrawer.

- [ ] make sure we readjust for dynamic changes

    - changing the exposed property
    - adding an item to the drawer
    - resizing an item in the drawer
    - change via properties, objects
    - change via CSS class name change
    
- [ ] have drawer images for demo
    - for each anchor point
    
- Happy face with drawer containing controls
    - set anchor
    - set exposed 
    - close drawer (function test)
    - change style (demo css)
    - change picture (demo sizes)    
    
- [ ] nested demo
