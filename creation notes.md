# Pull Reveal
### Second attempt

- Have it working for positioning from all 8 anchor points
- Drawer must contain any handle decorations, if desired.

- [X] I. change name from PullRevealPage to PullRevealContainer or
PullRevealContext, and from PullReveal to PullRevealDrawer.

- [ ] II. make sure we readjust for dynamic changes
    - changing the anchor property
    - changing the exposed property
    - adding an item to the drawer
    - resizing an item in the drawer
    - change via properties, objects
    - change via CSS class name change
    
- [ ] III. have drawer images for demo
    - for each anchor point
    
- [ ] IV. Happy face with drawer containing controls
    - set anchor
    - set exposed 
    - close drawer (function test)
    - change style (demo css)
    - change picture (demo sizes)    
    
- [ ] V. nested demo
    - bottom
    - right
    - topLeft
    
- [ ] VI. full demo
    - bottom
    - top
    - bottomRight    
    
- [ ] VII. auto open demo
    - Since we don't have this in the drawer
    - full page demo with button to open.
               
- [ ] VIII. prep and publish
    - [ ] documentation
